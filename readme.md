# F1 Fantasy Optimizer Web Application

A Dockerized Flask application for building the optimal F1 Fantasy team. It calculates driver and constructor value for money (VFM) metrics and analyzes track affinity to recommend the best swaps.

## Features

- **VFM Calculation**: Analyzes driver and constructor performance with outlier removal
- **Track Affinity Analysis**: Determines how well drivers/constructors perform at specific track types
- **Two-Step Optimization**: Optimizes team selection for the next two races
- **Risk Tolerance Settings**: Choose between consistent performers or track-specific optimization
- **Interactive Web Interface**: Easy-to-use web UI for configuration and results
- **Default Data Support**: Upload data once and reuse it for multiple optimizations
- **Configuration Memory**: Each user's last team configuration is saved and reloaded on login
- **Docker Support**: Fully containerized for easy deployment
- **User Authentication**: Login via Google, Facebook, GitHub or a local account
- **Administration Panel**: Manage data files and configure automated email optimisation
- **Queued Jobs & Automated Emails**: Optimisations run in the background and emailed results
- **Statistics Dashboard**: Visualise data and export statistics to Excel

## Optimization Process

The optimizer runs in three main stages:

### 1. Value For Money (VFM) Calculation

Driver and constructor race results are cleaned using a standard deviation based
outlier filter before calculating a weighted average of points. Outliers more
than `outlier_stddev_factor` standard deviations from the mean are replaced with
`NaN`. When using the trend‑based weighting scheme, points are weighted
according to the slope of recent performance. Improving trends favour
exponential weights while declining trends receive heavier decay. Other schemes
(equal, linear, exponential and moderate decay) compute fixed weights for all
races.

If FP2 lap data is available the optimizer queries the OpenF1 API, converts lap
times into pace scores and scales VFM values accordingly. When adjusting
constructors, the pace score is taken as the average of all drivers on the team.

### 2. Track Affinity Analysis

Historical race points are merged with circuit characteristics and cleansed with
an IQR‑based outlier detector that also uses rolling standard deviation to
dynamically tighten bounds. Categorical track features are label encoded before
estimating how strongly each characteristic correlates with past points.
Importance weights are derived from the variance of each characteristic.

Correlations combine long and short term trends. Robust correlation metrics
(linear, quadratic and threshold based) are blended and weighted by bootstrap
confidence estimates to reduce noise. Interaction effects between pairs of
characteristics further refine each driver or constructor affinity, producing a
score for every circuit.

### 3. Two‑Step Team Optimization

Team selection is optimized for the next two races. Track affinities adjust VFM
for each upcoming circuit and points are scaled by the selected driver boost
multiplier. Candidate swaps are generated from the top ranked drivers and
constructors while respecting the budget and maximum swap limits.

Each swap pattern is evaluated to maximise expected points per million of budget
and the search can optionally use an integer linear programming solver for exact
optimization. Results for both steps are compared to the baseline team to report
the expected improvement.

## Configuration Options

- **Weighting Scheme**: How to weight historical performance
  - Trend-based: Adaptive weights based on performance trends
  - Equal: All races weighted equally
  - Linear/Exponential decay: Recent races weighted more

- **Risk Tolerance**:
  - Low: Prioritizes consistent performers
  - Medium: Balanced approach
  - High: Prioritizes track-specific performance

## Optimization Parameters

These advanced settings are loaded from `default_data/settings.json` and can be
adjusted on the Administration page.

- **outlier_stddev_factor** – Number of standard deviations used to filter
  outlier race results. Increase this value to keep more data and smooth
  performance trends. Decrease it to remove anomalies and focus on typical
  results.
- **trend_slope_threshold** – Minimum slope for the trend-based weighting to
  treat a driver or constructor as improving or declining. Higher values make
  the algorithm less sensitive to short-term swings, while lower values react
  more quickly.
- **recent_races_fraction** – Fraction of all races considered "recent" when
  blending long-term and short-term correlations. A larger fraction incorporates
  more races, whereas a smaller fraction focuses on the latest events.
- **long_term_weight** – Proportion of long-term correlation in the blended
  score. Increase to rely more on season-long form; decrease to emphasize recent
  results.
- **interaction_weight** – Weight applied to track interaction correlations.
  Raising this value makes driver/constructor-track affinities more influential
  in the final optimization, while lowering it reduces that effect.
- **top_n_candidates** – Limit on the number of swap candidates considered.
- **use_ilp** – Use integer linear programming for exact optimisation.
- **poll_interval_minutes** – How often to poll the OpenF1 laps API for new data.
- **lap_stale_minutes** – How long the latest lap must remain unchanged before queued optimisations run.
- **smtp_host**/**smtp_port**/**smtp_username**/**smtp_password**/**smtp_tls**/**smtp_from** – SMTP settings for email results.

## Data Persistence

The application supports three types of data persistence:

1. **Default Data**: CSV files stored in `default_data/` directory
   - Persists across Docker container restarts
   - Shared across all optimization sessions
   - Updated only when explicitly requested

2. **Configuration Memory**: Last used team configuration per user
   - Saved to the user's profile after each optimization
   - Automatically loaded whenever the user logs in

3. **Results History**: All optimization results
   - Saved in `results/` directory
   - Each result has a unique timestamp
   - Can be downloaded as JSON

## Development

### Running without Docker

1. Install Python 3.9+
2. Install dependencies: `pip install -r requirements.txt`
3. Run the app: `python app.py`

### File Structure

```

## Testing

Install development requirements and run the tests using `pytest`:

```bash
pytest -q
```

To measure code coverage:

```bash
pytest --cov=f1_optimizer -q
```

The included tests currently achieve around **59%** coverage of `f1_optimizer.py`.

## Environment Variables

- `FLASK_SECRET_KEY`: Secret key for Flask sessions (default: auto-generated)
- `FLASK_ENV`: Flask environment (production/development)
- `GOOGLE_CLIENT_ID`: Google OAuth client ID
- `GOOGLE_CLIENT_SECRET`: Google OAuth client secret
- `FACEBOOK_CLIENT_ID`: Facebook OAuth client ID
- `FACEBOOK_CLIENT_SECRET`: Facebook OAuth client secret
- `GITHUB_CLIENT_ID`: Github OAuth client ID
- `GITHUB_CLIENT_SECRET`: Github OAuth client secret
- `ADMIN_EMAILS`: Comma separated list of administrator emails

Create a `.env` file (or copy `.env.example`) with the variables above set to
your provider credentials. Docker Compose will automatically load this file.

## Authentication

Register OAuth credentials with each provider and set the environment variables above.
Use the following callback URL for all providers: `https://<your-domain>/authorize/<provider>`.
Replace `<provider>` with `google`, `facebook`, or `github`.
Only users whose email appears in `ADMIN_EMAILS` will see the Administration page.

## Troubleshooting

- **Port already in use**: Change the port in docker-compose.yml and app.py
- **File upload errors**: Ensure CSV files are properly formatted
- **Default data not loading**: Check that files exist in `default_data/` directory
- **Optimization errors**: Check that driver/constructor names match exactly between files
- **Memory issues**: For large datasets, increase Docker memory allocation

## Security Notes

- This is designed for local/private use
- Authentication via Google, Facebook and GitHub SSO is now supported. A local
  username/password option is also available. Local accounts require an email
  address so administrator permissions can be granted via the `ADMIN_EMAILS`
  environment variable.
- Uploaded files are stored locally
